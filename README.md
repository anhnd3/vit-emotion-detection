# Emotion Recognition with Vision Transformer (ViT)

This project demonstrates an advanced emotion recognition system built using Google's Vision Transformer (ViT), showcasing transformer-based approaches applied directly to images.

## Project Overview

Emotion recognition is a critical task in human-computer interaction, enhancing user experiences in fields ranging from healthcare to marketing. Our implementation leverages the power of ViT, which transforms images into sequences of patches processed by transformer encoders to achieve state-of-the-art performance in image classification.
